Although there is some evidence  that  BERT  has  rich  syntactic  knowledge, our adversarial approach suggests that it is not deployed in a robust and linguistically appropriate way. English BERT can be tricked to miss even quite simple syntactic generalizations, when compared with GPT-2, underscoring the need for stronger priors and for linguistically controlled experiments in evaluation.","tags":null,"title":"Look at that!

There is growing evidence that acceptability judgements are shaped by the statistics of the input. In this paper, we focus on a type of constraint operative in long-distance dependencies (e.g. *wh*-questions, relative clauses, topicalizations, etc.) which has been claimed to result from verb subcategorization frequency effects.  We take a closer look at this hypothesis, and conclude that it does not account for the sentence acceptability contrasts. Rather, the evidence we find suggests that the acceptability of these dependencies hinges on clause-level semantic-pragmatic factors.","tags":null,"title":"Investigating the Role of Verb Frequency in Factive and Manner-of-speaking Islands","type":"publication"}]
