    <h1 class="important">How natural are these English sentences?</h1>

    <p style="color:#FF0000";>
      <span class="important">Content warning:</span> You will encounter some sentences that you may find uncomfortable. Some sentences may contain swearing, or allude to sensitive topics such as sex, violence, abuse, racism, war, religion, or politics.
      Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to continue.
    </p>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <p>
      You will be asked to view sets of <span class="important">two sequential sentences</span> in English. You may assume each set of sentences comes from a larger paragraph. You must rate the naturalness of the <span class="important">second sentence</span> in the set from <i>extremely <b>un</b>natural</i>
      to <i>perfectly natural</i>, taking into account the provided sentence that came immediately before it. You will answer each question by selecting a point 
      on a sliding scale. Please answer as precisely as possible. <u>Please rate the naturalness of <em>only</em> the second sentence.</u>
    </p>

    <p>
      Please read each sentence <i>carefully.</i> When assessing the <span class="important">second sentence</span> in each pair,
      please consider how the sentence would sound...
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        ...spoken <span class="important">immediately after the first sentence.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        ...spoken <span class="important">exactly as written.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        ...spoken by a <span class="important">native and fluent speaker of standard American English.</span>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Some sentences may contain terms you are unfamiliar with, or contain confusing circumstances. That is perfectly okay! Simply do your best to understand the task and provide your responses based on the information provided.
      If you encounter any terms you're unsure about, please try to interpret them as best you can.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few of the questions in this task will contain sets of sentences that obviously do not go together, or sentences that sound obviously extremely unnatural or perfectly natural.
      These are questions we already know the answers to. If you
      are paying attention, you are certain to get these questions right. <i>If you answer a majority of these such questions wrong, then you risk
      being rejected from the HIT.</i>
