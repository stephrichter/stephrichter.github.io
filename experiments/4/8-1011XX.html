    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <p>
      You will be asked to rate the naturalness of 65 different English sentences from <i>extremely <b>un</b>natural</i>
      to <i>perfectly natural</i>. You will answer each question by selecting a point 
      on a sliding scale. Please answer as precisely as possible. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Some sentences will have only small differences, or contain unusual circumstances. Please read each sentence <i>carefully.</i> When assessing each sentence,
      please consider how each sentence would sound...
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        ...spoken <span class="important">exactly as written.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        ...spoken by a <span class="important">native and fluent speaker of standard American English.</span>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- <p>
      Some sentences may be purposefully vague. That is perfectly okay! Simply do your best to understand the task and provide your responses based on the information provided.
    </p> -->

    <p>
      A few of the questions in this task will contain sentences that sound obviously extremely unnatural or perfectly natural.
      These are questions we already know the answers to. If you
      are paying attention, you are certain to get these questions right. <i>If you answer a majority of these such questions wrong, then you risk
      being rejected from the HIT.</i>
